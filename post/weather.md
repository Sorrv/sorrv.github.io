Was the weather forecaster wrong? Why didn't snow at your place?

Actually the general public widely misunderstood the chance of rain, or the **Probability of Precipitation** (*PoP*).

So what does an 80% probability of precipitation mean?

- Some might take this to mean that it will rain about 80% of the time in a given forecast period.
- Some would say that 80% of a given forecast area will be covered by precipitation.

- There are other reviews that say there is an 80% chance of rain in the area.
- Or 8 weather forecasters think it will rain and 2 others disagree.

Which of perspective is right?

The answer is no one exactly correct. According to the Bureau of Meteorology's explaination, the PoP is predetermined by the **Confidence** percentage and the percentage of the **Area** with precipitation both.

> PoP[^PoP] = C[^Confidence] • A[^Area]

[^PoP]:Probability of Precipitation
[^Confidence]:the Confidence percentage
[^Area]:the percentage of the Area with precipitation
## Examples

a 50% chance of rain tomorrow morning have many situations:

50% = 100% × 50%

50% = 90% × 55.5^%

50% = 80% × 62.5%

50% = 75% × 66.6^%

50% = 60% × 83.3^%

50% = 50% × 100%

Of course, behind these simple numbers are conclusions drawn by meteorologists through mathematical derivation, analysis of weather records when similar situations occurred, and complex models.

Next time you see a 30% PoP, will you bring an umbrella before going out?
